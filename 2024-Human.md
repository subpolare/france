# ü´Ä Human Physiology

ü´Å Introduction to human medical physiology and the main diseases of various organ systems. We will discuss all human organ systems and in general terms their structure and functioning. From the medical part, we will touch a little on medicines and various diseases. We will omit only the immune system, since it was discussed [before](https://github.com/subpolare/france/blob/main/2023-Virology-Immunology.md). Also [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/GrtnUE2wBBBAsQ) you can download all the presentations at once.

üìö As additional literature, I can leave several groups of ooks at once. There are a couple of good English ooks on Yandex.Disk, and in VK posts there are mostly Russian books with a brief description.
