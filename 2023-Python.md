# üíª Python in Biology 

üë®‚Äçüíª These notebooks are intended for learning the Python programming language in relation to biological disciplines and bioinformatics in particular. Lessons are held in the [Google Coollaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which can be used for any programming in Python, BASH and another. Autumn course, 2023.

## Supplementary and aditional materials

üìö **Additional literature** and lectures on the block, development paths and a little bit about why Python is needed at all can be found at the link [in the corresponding article](https://vk.com/@nachatoi-literatura-po-python). It is updated every few months as I learn about new courses. If you also know something interesting that is in the public domain, I will be glad to add it to the article. 

ü´† **An anecdote** about bioinformatics, which will not leave questions about who these strange people are (and you have already become them a little), can be read on [website ¬´–≠–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã¬ª](https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/432183/Bioinformatiki_proiskhozhdenie_i_zhiznennyy_tsikl). I advise everyone to read it! Without this, it is impossible to get a credit (joke). 

üìë **The article** about the variants of start codons and stop codons and their evolution to the tasks of the fourth lecture can be found on [the same website ¬´–≠–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã¬ª](https://elementy.ru/problems/3023/Ot_nachala_do_kontsa). I tried to draw beautiful pictures and describe it in as much detail as possible from the point of view of molecular biology.
